CSE 131 PROJECT 1 (WINTER 2016)

Some parts of the lexer rules are pretty self explanatory (keywords, integer constants, operators, etc), so our README will skip over those explanations and get down to the more complex parts of the project.

1. MULTILINE COMMENTS

2. FLOAT CONSTANTS

3. IDENTIFIERS

4. LINE AND COLUMN NUMBERS
