Extra Credit:
	We have some error reporting. It will display all the top level errors, and shows where the error is, instead of just the first syntax error.

	We also implemented jump statements.

How we Structured out code:
	We followed the manual, but it gave us a lot of shift/reduce conflicts, so we modified the grammar so that it would be unambiguous. We also made some intermediate classes for storing data and switching between different types.

How we tested:
	We went through all the provided test files, and implemented some of our own tests.
